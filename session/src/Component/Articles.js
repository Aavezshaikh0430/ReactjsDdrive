        On 26 October 2020, Siraj was named in India's Test squad for their
        series against Australia.[22] After some deliberation to choose between
        Navdeep Saini and Siraj following an injury to Mohammad Shami, Siraj was
        chosen ahead of Saini, and he made his Test debut for India on 26
        December 2020, against Australia.[23][24] His first Test wicket was of
        Marnus Labuschagne.[25] In January 2021, during the fourth Test of the
        series against Australia, Siraj took his first five-wicket haul in Test
        cricket.[26]

        In January 2023, Siraj placed important role in the Ind vs NZ ODI
        series. He took 4 wickets in the first ODI which helped the team to win
        the match for 12 runs.[27] On January 21, 2023 Siraj became No. 1 ODI
        Bowler in ICC ODI Rankings for Bowlers.[28] Mohammed Siraj jumped to top
        spot in the ICC ODI Rankings after sensational performance against New
        Zealand. Team India's star bowler Mohammed Siraj climbed to top spot in
        the ICC ODI rankings on Wednesday, following a consistent run of
        performances in the series against Sri Lanka and New Zealand this month.
        Siraj had picked nine wickets in three matches against Sri Lanka, and
        took a four-wicket haul in the opening match of the series against the
        Kiwis. Siraj has 729 rating points in the bowler's rankings in the
        format and leads – albeit narrowly – Australia's Josh Hazlewood by two
        rating points.
